<h1>Caenorhabiditis elegans<h1>
<p>The nematode C. elegans is a tiny worm that keeps many scientist around the world busy. The work with the worm was honored by 2 nobelprizes<br> 
   Sidney Brenner introduced this nematode as model organism to study neuronal networks and <br> development over 50 years ago.
   The worm helped to make many important <br> discoveries as for example a first full description of a neuronal network, lifespan prolonged genes, and RNAi.</P>

<h1>Drosophila melangolaster<h1>
<p>Research with the fruit fly started with Charles Woodworth. It was the first genetic model organism and was honored with 8 nobelprizes.<br> 
   Important work was done by Christina Nuesslein Vollhard and collegues in the 80s. She discovered important developmental genes and described their function</P>

<h1>Zebrafish<h1>
<p> George Streisinger and collegues started in the 1979s to use D. rerio in their labs.<br> 
    It is a tiny fresh water fish with an incredible regenerative abilities. It is finding cures for spinal cord injuries.</P>
